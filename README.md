# EdgeOS

## Purpose for Fork

This is a fork of the EdgeOS integration by [elad-bar](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-edgeos/) While that author is busy, this integrates 2 important patches:
- fix_unknown_devices (resolves issues #153 and #154)
- unknown_devices_dict (makes each item in unknown_devices.attributes.leased a dict - see #157)

I will try to keep up with the head integration but no guarantees are providied.

## Description

Provides an integration between EdgeOS (Ubiquiti) routers to Home Assistant.

[Changelog](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-edgeos/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## How to

#### Requirements

- EdgeRouter with at least firmware version 2.0
- EdgeRouter User with 'Operator' level access or higher
- Traffic Analysis set to 'Enabled' (both `dpi` and `export` enabled under `system/traffic-analysis`)
- To enable / disable interfaces an `admin` role is a required

#### Installations via HACS

- In HACS, look for "Ubiquiti EdgeOS Routers" and install and restart
- In Settings --> Devices & Services - (Lower Right) "Add Integration"

#### Setup

To add integration use Configuration -> Integrations -> Add `EdgeOS`
Integration supports **multiple** EdgeOS devices

| Username    | Textbox | +        | -       | Username of user with `Operator` level access or higher, better to create a dedicated user for that integration for faster issues identification |
| Password    | Textbox | +        | -       |                                                                                                                                                  |

| Could not retrieve device data from EdgeOS Router                                  |
| Export (traffic-analysis) configuration is disabled, please enable                 |
| Deep Packet Inspection (traffic-analysis) configuration is disabled, please enable |
| Unsupported firmware version                                                       |

###### Encryption key got corrupted

If a persistent notification popped up with the following message:

```
Encryption key got corrupted, please remove the integration and re-add it
```

It means that encryption key was modified from outside the code,
Please remove the integration and re-add it to make it work again.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug logs

To set the log level of the component to DEBUG, please set it from the options of the component if installed, otherwise, set it within configuration YAML of HA:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.edgeos: debug
```

### Diagnostic file

In Settings -> Devices & services, look for the device, click on the 3 dots menu and download diagnostic file,

Diagnostic file contains sensitive details, go over it and clean it or send it directly to my [email](elad.bar@hotmail)

### Known issues and workarounds

**Upgrading to v2.1.x**
In case the following error appear:

`ERROR (MainThread) [custom_components.edgeos] Failed to load EdgeOS, error: , line: 36`

Before opening an issue, please try to remove integration from `Settings -> Devices & services`,

Restart HA and try to add again, if still happen, open an issue and provide log with debug level as described above.
